    <h1>Kabul</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Kabul</b>[a] (Pashto[b], Dari:[c] کابل), is the capital and largest
      city of Afghanistan. Located in the eastern half of the country, it is
      also a municipality, forming part of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul_Province">Kabul Province</a>.
      The city is divided for administration into
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul#Districts" target="_blank"
        >22 municipal districts</a
      >. Kabul's population was estimated in 2023 at about 4.95 million.[8] In
      contemporary times, Kabul has served as Afghanistan's political, cultural
      and economical center.[9] Rapid urbanization has made it the country's
      primate city and one of the largest cities in the world.[10]

      The modern-day city of Kabul is located high in a narrow valley in the
      Hindu Kush mountain range, and is bounded by the Kabul River. At an
      elevation of 1,790 metres (5,873 ft), it is one of the highest capital
      cities in the world. The center of the city contains its old
      neighborhoods, including the areas of Khashti Bridge, Khabgah, Kahforoshi,
      Saraji, Chandavel, Shorbazar, Deh-Afghanan and Ghaderdiwane.[11]

      Kabul is said to be over 3,500 years old, and was mentioned at the time of
      the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Located at a crossroads in Asia—roughly
      halfway between Istanbul, Turkey, in the west and Hanoi, Vietnam, in the
      east—the city is situated in a strategic location along the trade routes
      of Central Asia and South Asia. It was a key destination on the ancient
      Silk Road[12] and was traditionally seen as the meeting point between
      Tartary, India and Persia.[13] Over the centuries Kabul has been under the
      rule of various dynasties and empires, including the Seleucids, Bactrian
      Greeks, Mauryans, the Kushans, the Hindu Shahis, Western Turks, the Turk
      Shahis, the Samanids, the Khwarazmians, the Timurids, the Mongols and the
      Arman Rayamajhis.
